# Machine Learning Interview Notes

ðŸ“˜ This repo contains my personal notes and summaries while learning machine learning and applied scientist interviews at top tech companies, such as Amazon.

## ðŸ“š Sections

- `classical-ml/`: Core machine learning models and concepts
- `deep-learning/`: Common neural network architectures and applications
- `model-evaluation/`: Model performance metrics and trade-offs
- `feature-engineering/`: Tricks to improve input data quality
- `experiment-design/`: A/B testing and statistics
- `explainability/`: Model interpretability tools like SHAP
- `projects/`: Case study-style notes based on real-world experience

## ðŸ§  Topics in Focus

- âœ… Time-series anomaly detection (LSTM)
- âœ… Tabular data modeling (XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
- âœ… A/B testing, p-values, and hypothesis testing
- âœ… Feature importance and explainability with SHAP
