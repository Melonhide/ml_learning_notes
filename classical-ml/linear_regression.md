## Assumptions:

- Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear.
- No Multicollinearity: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. (Variance Inflation Factor > 10)
- Independence of Errors: The residuals are independent of each other (no autocorrelation).
- Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables. Var(ei) = Var(ej)
- Normality of Errors: The residuals (errors) are normally distributed. E(e) = 0 (Markov Process)
- No Measurement Error in X: The independent variables are measured without error and are fixed (non-random).
